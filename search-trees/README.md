Binary Search Tree
==================

Trees can come in many different shapes, and they can vary in the number of 
children allowed per node or in the way they organize data values within the
nodes. One of the most commonly used trees in computer science is the binary
tree. A binary tree is a tree in which each node can have at most two children. 
On child is identified as the left child and the other as the right child. The 
topmost node of the tree is known as the root node.It provides the single 
acccess point into the structure. The root node is the only node in the tree 
that does not have an incoming edge (an edge directed towart it). By definition 
every non=empty tree must have contain a root node.
